This dataset that I chose gives data on salary information about various jobs from assorted industries around the world. 
I chose it because this dataset seemed to be easy to use and there seemed to be interesting questions that could be asked about it.
I will be using mainly the Seaborn and Pandas library to manipulate this data and find out what I can from it.

The questions I have to be answered that I can find out through data manipulation and visualization are as follows:
    
- [ ]1. Make a histogram of all the salaries.
- [ ]2. Make a pie chart of all the job titles in the data set. Which appears the most common?
- [ ]3. What is the correlation between gender and salary?
- [ ]4. Is there a disparity among race and salary?
- [ ]5. How does age, education level and years of experience correlate with salary?
- [ ]6. Which of the genders is more represented in this list?
- [ ]7. What is the correlation between seniority and race?
- [ ]8. Is there a disparity between seniority and years of experience?
- [ ]9. What jobs on average are the highest paying?
- [ ]10. What jobs are the lowest paying?
