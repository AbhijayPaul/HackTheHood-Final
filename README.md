# HackTheHood Final Lowest Rated Movies

This dataset that I chose gives data on the 100 lowest ranked movies on IMDb. 
I chose it because this dataset seemed to be easy to use and it seemed to have interesting questions to ask about it.
I will be using mainly the Seaborn and Pandas library to manipulate this data and find out what I can from it.

The questions I have to be answered that I can find out through data manipulation and visualization are as follows:
    
    1. What age rating appears the most in this dataset?
    2. What time period appears most common in this dataset?
    3. Which Genre appears most often in this dataset?
    4. Is there a trend between the review count and the rating?
    5. Which writer shows up most often in this dataset?
    6. Which director shows up most often in this dataset?
    7. Which actors show up most often in this dataset?
    8. Is there a correlation between movie length and rating?
    9. How correlated are the ranks and the ratings of the movies?
    10. Of the directors that show up the most on this list, is there a correlation between what year they released said movie and its rank on the list?
