# HackTheHood Final Lowest Rated Movies

This dataset that I chose gives data on the 100 lowest ranked movies on IMDb. 
I chose it because this dataset seemed to be easy to use and it seemed to have interesting questions to ask about it.
I will be using mainly the Seaborn and Pandas library to manipulate this data and find out what I can from it.

The questions I have to be answered that I can find out through data manipulation and visualization are as follows:
    
    1. Is there an age rating that the movies are rated as that appears the most common in this dataset
    2.
